## Basic functionality

### Authentication

**Endpoints:**

```
POST /api/auth/signup
```
```
POST /api/auth/login
```
```
POST /api/auth/logout
```
```
POST /api/auth/refresh_token
```

*The names speak for themselves*

The application uses JWT tokens for authentication. Users have three roles: regular user, moderator, and administrator.

To implement different access levels (regular user, moderator, and administrator),
FastAPI decorators are used to check the token and user role.

### Working with photos

**Users can perform various operations related to photos:**

- Upload photos with descriptions.
    ```
    POST /api/upload_picture
    ```
- Delete photos.
    ```
    DELETE /api/photos/{picture_id}
    ```
- Edit photo descriptions.
    ```
    PATCH /api/photos/{picture_id}
    ```
- Retrieve a photo by a unique link.
    ```
    GET /api/photos/{picture_id}
    ```
- Add up to 5 tags per photo.


- Apply basic photo transformations using 
[Cloudinary services](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations).
    ```
    POST /api/photos/transform
    ```
- Generate links to transformed images for viewing as URL and QR-code. Links are stored on the server.

With the help of [FastAPI decorators, described above](#authentication), 
administrators can perform all CRUD operations with user photos.

### Comments

**Under each photo, there is a comment section. Users can:**

- Add and read comments to each other's photos.
  ```
  POST /api/comments
  ```
  ```
  GET /api/comments
  ```
- Open and edit comment.
  ```
  GET /api/comments/{comment_id}
  ```
  ```
  PATCH /api/comments/{comment_id}
  ```
- Administrators and moderators [if you have the role](#authentication) can delete comments.
  ```
  DELETE /api/comments/{comment_id}
  ```

### Profile

**Endpoints for user profile:**

- See your profile.
    ```
    GET /api/users/me
    ```
- Edit your profile, or change your avatar.
    ```
    PATCH /api/users/me
    ```
    ```
    PATCH /api/users/avatar
    ```
- See another user's profile.
    ```
    GET /api/users/{username}
    ```
- Ban users, if you have the [administrator role](#authentication).
    ```
    PATCH /api/users/{username}
    ```

- Create a route for a user profile based on their unique username.
It returns all user information, including name, registration date, and the number of uploaded photos.

- Users can edit their own information and view it.

- Administrators can deactivate users (ban them). Inactive users cannot log in.
